# Electric Vehicle Sales Data Analysis

## 🔍 Project Summary
The global shift toward sustainable transportation has significantly increased the adoption of **Electric Vehicles (EVs)**.  
This project analyzes **electric vehicle sales data** to understand market trends, growth patterns, and consumer adoption across different regions and time periods.

The objective of this analysis is to transform raw EV sales data into **actionable insights** using data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization techniques.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Electric vehicle sales data is often large, fragmented, and difficult to interpret without structured analysis.  
This project aims to answer key questions such as:

- How have EV sales changed over time?
- Which regions or states show the highest adoption?
- What vehicle categories contribute most to EV growth?
- Are there noticeable seasonal or year-wise trends?

---

## 📂 Dataset Description
- Data Type: Electric Vehicle Sales Data
- Format: CSV
- Time Coverage: Multi-year sales records
- Key Columns:
  - Year / Month
  - Region / State
  - Vehicle Category (2W, 3W, 4W, etc.)
  - Units Sold
  - Manufacturer (if available)

The dataset required cleaning due to missing values, inconsistent naming, and duplicate records.

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation
The following preprocessing steps were performed:

- Removed duplicate entries
- Standardized column names and categorical values
- Handled missing and null values
- Converted date fields into proper datetime format
- Aggregated sales data at monthly and yearly levels

These steps ensured the dataset was ready for meaningful analysis.

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Key analytical steps included:

- Year-wise and month-wise EV sales trend analysis
- Region-wise comparison of EV adoption
- Vehicle category contribution analysis
- Growth rate evaluation using percentage change
- Identification of peak sales periods

Visualizations were used extensively to highlight trends and patterns.

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- Electric vehicle sales show **consistent year-on-year growth**
- Certain regions/states demonstrate significantly higher adoption
- Two-wheelers and passenger EVs contribute the majority of sales
- Sales spikes indicate policy impact and seasonal demand
- Adoption is accelerating in urban and high-infrastructure regions
